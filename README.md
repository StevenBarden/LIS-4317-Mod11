Minimalist Mastery: Crafting a Tufte-Inspired Dot-Dash Scatterplot in R

This repository contains my solution for Module 11 of LIS-4317 Introduction to Visual Analytics at USF.
The script LIS4317Mod11.R creates a Tufte-style dot-dash scatterplot using ggplot2 and the mtcars dataset.
It follows Edward Tufteâ€™s minimalist principles, reducing non-data ink with rug marks and a clean design.
The output is saved as dot_dash_ggplot2.pdf, showcasing car weight vs. fuel efficiency in a vector format.
